# Trials and tribulations of Linear Regression

## Where do you even start?
>   Linear regression is an amazing tool for making predictions and interpreting relationships. You can find and create features from a data set and use them to predict a target variable.  The catch, however, is that if those features don't accurately explain the change in the target variable, the linear regression model will not be able to accurately predict anyhting.

>   So how can you get features that will work together to be accurate?
That is the ultimate question.

>   My attempt to answer that question is in no way exact but rather a representation of how situationally dependent the process is.  What variable are you trying to predict? How do you want to interpret the results? How do you want manipulate the data to work towards finding a linear relationship? What if I develop a great plan to answer all these questions but my results are woefully underwhelming?  These are the questions that circled around my head and kept me awake most nights while working on a linear regression project.

>   After frequenting the pit of despair for routine ear washing and eye gouging(get the membership rewards card), I forfeited all hopes that I was going to develop a perfect model.  I decided that I could only hope to improve each attempt.  After seeing results from each attempt, I tried to think of ways I could improve the features or ways I could create better features.  Lather, rinse, and repeat, all while keeping track of different changes so that I could better understand how my changes were affecting the model.
