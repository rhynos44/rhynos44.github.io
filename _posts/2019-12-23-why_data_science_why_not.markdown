I have worked in the restaurant industry for close to fifteen years.  For those that do not know, getting through a shift in this field is similar to getting on a roller coaster with no seatbelts.  You just have to hang on and hope you can make it through.  The ultimate goal is to serve as many people as possible, as much as possible, as quickly as possible.  This strategy is far from scientific and allows for a tremendous amount of error.  I have always been a person that wants to improve and solve problems.  It has been a frustrating field to work in simply because there's never any analysis done to try and figure out how to improve as a business.  The reason there is no analysis is because analysis requires data and data is simply not collected in a restaurant.  This brings me to the answer to the question, 'Why data science?'

Why not use data science?  If you want to make decisions based on scientific data and analysis then data science is the way to go.  I want to be a part of something that helps people make decisions they won't regret.
