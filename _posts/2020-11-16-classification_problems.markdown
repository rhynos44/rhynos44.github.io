### Why it is important:
> It is one thing to be able to predict a value given data, but to be able to determine if something can be classified as a certain category is a whole different game.  This is the basis of supervised machine learning.  The outcome is known and trained on.  In classification problems, usually it is a binary classification where the target variable is either a yes or a no.

### Cool aspects:

> Since this is data science, of course there are several cool apects to classification problems and supervised learning.  A great part of these problems is parameter tuning.

> Tuning parameters is crucial to making sure the optimal model is acheived.  When starting out with the classifier model, an optimal minimum error should be established.  This way the model's performance can be tracked as all the parameters change.  Changing the parameters is a great way to experiment on how to minimize the error.

> Another cool aspect is using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to figure out how important a certian feature is to the target variable.  This helps determine what might be important to the relatable business decision.
