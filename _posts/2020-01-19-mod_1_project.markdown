This project presented a multiple of challenges.  The most difficult was developing a strategy that would dictate my workflow and sticking with it.  I changed between multiple ideas as far as how I wanted to pitch my idea.  Did it make more sense to look at ratings or was it a better idea to focus on the financial side and see how the different aspects of a movie could relate to a financial outcome.

I decided to investigate the financial aspect and look at the actors/actresses, directors, writers, and producers to and visualize the top 25 in each category in regards to the top grossing films.

The top grossing films were selected based on the top half of the worldwide gross column.  I normalized this data so that I would get the top half of a normal distribution.  I also decided to keep outliers, since these outliers only displayed films that were extraordinarily successful based on their gross profit.
